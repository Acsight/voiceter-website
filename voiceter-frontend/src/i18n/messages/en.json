    "questions": {
      "q1": {
        "question": "How is this different from traditional CATI software?",
        "answer": "Traditional CATI requires human interviewers who manually make calls. Voiceter.ai uses AI voice agents that conduct conversations automatically, enabling 24/7 operation, instant scalability, and 80% cost reduction while maintaining or improving quality."
      },
      "q2": {
        "question": "Which languages do you support?",
        "answer": "Initially we support English (US), English (UK), English (AU), Spanish, German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Other languages will be supported within our roadmap."
      },
      "q3": {
        "question": "Is it really compliant with TCPA and GDPR?",
        "answer": "Yes. Compliance is built into every call. We automatically handle consent verification, DNC list checking, call recording disclosures, opt-out requests, and data handling requirements for both TCPA (US) and GDPR (EU), plus other regional regulations."
      },
      "q4": {
        "question": "What kind of surveys work best with AI voice agents?",
        "answer": "AI voice agents excel at structured surveys (NPS, CSAT, CES), product feedback, brand perception studies, employee engagement, and customer experience surveys. They handle complex skip logic, multiple question types, and even open-ended questions with sophisticated conversation AI."
      },
      "q5": {
        "question": "Can I integrate this into my existing platform?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We're API-first. Use our RESTful API and webhooks to embed voice surveys into your product, connect with your CRM, or integrate with research platforms. We also offer pre-built connectors for Salesforce, Zapier, and major CX platforms."
      },
      "q6": {
        "question": "What about response rates compared to traditional surveys?",
        "answer": "Our AI voice agents achieve 40-60% better response rates than traditional CATI. The conversational, natural approach feels more engaging than robocalls, and our smart scheduling optimizes contact timing for each recipient."
      },
      "q7": {
        "question": "How do you handle open-ended questions?",
        "answer": "Our AI uses advanced natural language processing to understand, follow up, and accurately transcribe open-ended responses. It can ask clarifying questions, recognize sentiment, and even identify themes across responses automatically."
      },
      "q8": {
        "question": "What's the pricing model?",
        "answer": "We offer flexible pricing for different needs: per-minute pricing for occasional users, monthly subscriptions for regular research programs, and enterprise agreements for high-volume needs. Join our waitlist to get benefit from our early adaptor rates."
      },

        "question": "When will Voiceter.ai be generally available?",

      "q10": {
        "question": "What kind of support do you provide?",
        "answer": "All plans include email support and comprehensive documentation. Professional and Enterprise plans include priority support, dedicated account management, and onboarding assistance. API users get technical support from our engineering team."
      },
      "q11": {
        "question": "Can I see my data in real-time?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our dashboard updates in real-time as responses come in. You can monitor call progress, view completed responses instantly, and access live analytics. API users can also receive webhook notifications for immediate data processing."
      },
      "q12": {
        "question": "What happens if someone doesn't answer?",
        "answer": "Our system automatically handles retry logic based on your preferences. We optimize retry timing based on call patterns, respect do-not-disturb hours, and can schedule callbacks. You control the retry strategy and frequency."
